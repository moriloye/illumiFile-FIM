= Recommended Installation =

illumiFile installation is very simple. It can be done in the
fast way (using the script install.sh with the default values)

Before running the script, make sure your system has the necessary
libraries and tools installed:
- libssl
- libpcre2
- libz
- make, gcc
- libsystemd-dev

On a Ubuntu/Debian system, these can be installed with:

apt install libz-dev libssl-dev libpcre2-dev build-essential libsystemd-dev

Fast way steps:

1- Run the script ./install.sh. It will guide you through the 
   installation process. 

2- Ensure you only select 'Y' for the integrity module, and 'N' for others.
   Install as LOCAL to use on a single PC.

3- The script will create everything in /var/ossec and try to
   create the initialization script in your system (/etc/rc.local
   or /etc/rc.d/init.d/ossec). If the init script is not created,
   make sure to follow the instructions from the install.sh to make
   the HIDS start during the boot. To start it by hand, just run
   /var/ossec/bin/ossec-control start

4- Enjoy.
